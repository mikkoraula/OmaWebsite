# website

## Introduction

My simple website for learning the stack and messing around with.

Uses React, Node.js, Express and Webpack. Development made using webpack-dev-server, eslint, prettier and babel!

## Development mode

In the development mode, we will have 2 servers running. The front end code will be served by the [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) which helps with hot and live reloading. The server side Express code will be served by a node server using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which helps in automatically restarting the server whenever server side code changes.

## Production mode

In the production mode, we will have only 1 server running. All the client side code will be bundled into static files using webpack and it will be served by the Node.js/Express application.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mikkoraula/OmaWebsite

# Go inside the directory
cd OmaWebsite

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (webpack-dev-server + nodemon)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Folder Structure

All the source code will be inside **src** directory. Inside src, there is client and server directory. All the frontend code (react, css, js and any other assets) will be in client directory. Backend Node.js/Express code will be in the server directory.
